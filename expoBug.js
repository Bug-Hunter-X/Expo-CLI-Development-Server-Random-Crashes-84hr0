While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server would randomly crash without any clear error messages in the terminal.  This occurred inconsistently, sometimes after a few minutes, sometimes after hours of development.  The only indication was the server process terminating and requiring a restart.  No relevant logs were found in the Expo Go app or the terminal.
