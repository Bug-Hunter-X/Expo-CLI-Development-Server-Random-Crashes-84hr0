# Expo CLI Development Server Random Crashes

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo CLI development server randomly crashes without providing any error messages. The issue is intermittent and doesn't present consistent repro steps. This makes debugging difficult.

## Bug Description
The Expo development server unexpectedly terminates without any errors displayed in the console. This forces developers to manually restart the server, interrupting workflow. The problem's inconsistency makes identifying the root cause challenging. No errors are visible within the Expo Go app or terminal logs.

## Reproduction Steps
Reproducing this bug is inconsistent and not reliable.  It seems to occur randomly after various periods of development time.

## Solution (expoBugSolution.js)
While a complete solution requires more investigation, implementing robust error handling and logging can help in pinpointing the cause.  The solution below suggests implementing custom error handling within your application to capture potential exceptions and log them to the console.
